# First Steps Into Programming

Welcome to my project on first steps into programming.

Repository content:
- `Chess_project.py` â€“ Python file with chess project.

Purpose:
The purpose of the project was to learn and practice Python skills from scratch. This includes learning Python functions, logic, troubleshooting, and writing programs according to given requirements.

Task description:
Implement a Python program that answers a simple question: given a board state that the user enters, with 1 white figure and up to 16 black figures, which black figures can the white figure take?

The program should:
1. Prompt the user to input a chess piece and its position on the board (white piece). The user can choose between two predefined pieces.
   - Format example: "knight a5"
2. Once the white piece is added successfully, prompt the user to enter black pieces one by one in the same format as the white piece. The user can add between 1 to 16 black pieces. Use "done" to finish adding black pieces.
3. After each piece addition, confirm if it was added successfully or provide an error message if there was an issue.
4. After adding both white and black pieces, the program should print which black pieces the white piece can take.

Assumptions:
- Users will input either "done" or the correct format for adding a piece ("piece coordinates").
- Coordinates will always be entered as letters a-h and digits 1-8 (e.g., a1, d4, h8).

Installation instructions:
1. Copy the code from the repository.
2. Paste it into Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
3. Run the code using Python.
